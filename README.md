# Diagnosis_Diabetes
in this project, the dataset was gathered from a medical database called the Pima Indian Database set. It contains 768 rows of data.
A 4-layer Artificial Neural Network was designed and trained using the
Back-propagation method and the Bayesian Regulation (BR) Algorithm. The back
propagation learning algorithm works by correcting errors as it “trains” itself to have
less errors. It models the computed output value with the expected value (1 or 0) since
it has binary output, 1 for true and 0 for false. The BR algorithm was used additionally
to avoid over fitting the data set.
