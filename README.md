# Diagnosis_Diabetes
this repository contains a deep learning project that focuses on the Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Technologies Used:

TensorFlow:

The popular deep learning framework is utilized for building and training the CNN model.

Keras: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow, which simplifies the model construction process.

Python: The programming language used for implementing the CNN model and handling data processing tasks.

dataset :
this project gathered the dataset from a medical database called the Pima Indian Database set. It contains 768 rows of data.
Model:

A 4-layer Artificial Neural Network was designed and trained using the
Back-propagation method and the Bayesian Regulation (BR) Algorithm. The back
propagation learning algorithm works by correcting errors as it “trains” itself to have
less errors. It models the computed output value with the expected value (1 or 0) since
it has binary output, 1 for true and 0 for false. The BR algorithm was used additionally
to avoid over fitting the data set.

The model was trained on the training set for 100 epochs, with a batch size of 20. The training process achieved an accuracy of  0.78 and a Testing loss: 0.49.
